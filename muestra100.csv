Burns",2,2,4,1341187200,"Attention AMAZON:","I think Amazon is doing a disservice to Wellness Dry Dog Food by mingling all the reviews together rather than separating the opinions out, based on the particular type and ""flavor"" of the Wellness food being reviewed.  I was researching the food for SMALL BREEDS and zeroed in on that particular type, but the reviews were all over the place talking about many of the other varieties.<br />My experience with using the dry Wellness for Small Breeds, both the regular type and the Healthy Weight type has been excellent.  All out mini dachshunds love the food, have beautiful coats and are very healthy.  My only suggestion is that they offer the SMALL BREED variety in super size bags.  Buying 12 lbs at a time is ridiculous when one is feeding multiple dogs, and many of us with little guys, have more than one..... the potato chip theory, right?"

We were surprised to find that it didn't taste anything like what we thought... in fact, in a very short time it became our year-round, #1 favorite beverage, even replacing soda. It has a deliciously tangy, refreshing taste - but without the sour, grapefruity taste we'd expected - or the sugar & calories. So that's the good news. The bad, dreadful news is that they've decided not to make it anymore! So once Amazon & other suppliers are out of this particularly perfect flavor... it'll be gone for good. )-:  *sigh*. Come on!

Some people like coffee that borders on tea, others like the stuff that a certain national chain named after a famous Battlestar Galactica pilot serves.  For the record, I love the slightly-sour taste of Dunkin Donuts coffee and I find the stuff made by ""that other chain"" to be akin to re-hydrated cigarette ash.  For many years, we still percolated coffee...with most big-name brands of pre-ground coffee, you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it, but again, your tastes may vary.<br /><br />With my Keurig, my favorite coffee was Paul Neumans Extra Bold....because it didn't seem Extra Bold.  Until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor.  Then, my favorites were the Caribu's....but something happened to that brand (see reviews) and I agree, they did something...either they don't put as much in the cups or they changed the blend, the sourcing of the beans, etc......wasted money on Caribu and wont go back to the brand.<br /><br />So Wolfgang Puck got the nod, tried 4 different flavors.  This one, Sorrento, is not my favorite of the bunch (currently Colombian Chef's Reserve).  It has a bolder strength (which I believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider Medium), but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it.  Cream and Sweetener don't correct for this, and thus I'm a bit disappointed....but again it was a stab in the dark.<br /><br />I think if you prefer a slightly bolder, slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee...this may be for you.  I like the character of the Colombian Chef's Reserve, but it is not as strong, and perhaps that is just what my taste is slanted towards.

Read the label.<br /><br />B) The batches may be uneven in cholesterol, and they may avoid legal issues by setting it at the 'max'. But the uneven textures and flavors you may get (I consumed, along with family and friends, several cases of these over 2 years or so) don't add up, either. I had burnt tones, teeth-cracking textures at times.<br /><br />I used to love these chips, much as the majority of the reviews portray. I thought I was enjoying at the least a fair product, staying healthy, keeping the fat away. But - they are simply simple carbs with a little twist of fat that get you by in the place of their higher-fat brethren. In case you are not sure of where I stand, I am one of those people who think carb-laden chips are not a great food. You don't miss health until you lose it. These chips will not help your health. They might, at best, make it slightly less worse than everyday chips - at twice or more the price.<br /><br />A leading non-profit consumer org concluded this was 'junk health food'. They cited other causes, as well. I wholeheartedly concur that this is not a healthy food. It is a junk food that is masquerading as one.<br /><br />ADDENDUM:<br /><br />Just got around to adding this. My wife purchased a bag of the ""Hickory Honey BBQ"" at the beginning of July. They were real dental-rattlers, uneven but thick-cut and baked into seriously hard material. The spices were horribly uneven.<br /><br />Lot mark: 12JUL12 090227921:37"

It also seems to clog up faster than I have experienced before.  I tend to have to remove the cap and clean it out at the sink in order to unclog it and remove the excess chili oil from dripping down the side of the bottle.

It's only been about a week since I received my Red Leaf Tea order, but I've had this tea three separate occasions since then. Every time I went to sit down and write a review - I was already finished my cup and I didn't quite know what to say.<br /><br />I think I understand what took me so long. This is a seriously mysterious matcha. When I opened the package and took a whiff, I associated the sweet vanilla smell with something else, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. I whisked up a cup between 175-185 degrees - the matcha itself was bright, vegetal, creeeamy and full of vanilla deliciousness. Definite vanilla bean or real vanilla extract - a flavour that isn't sweet but is associated with baking. When I bake with my 3 tablespoons+ of real vanilla - it always smells sooo delicious and sweet, but if you were to taste it itself - it doesn't taste how it smells. That's the opposite of this matcha - it really does taste how it smells - I think that's where the mystery came from.<br /><br />Finally I associated the smell with the matcha whipped shortbread I made a while back. Of course! It smells and tastes like delicious flour, sugar, matcha and vanilla! Since I ate over a dozen of those cookies, it's now obvious where that taste association comes from haha. Love it.  I really want to do a comparison of this vs the new French Vanilla matcha. Subtle but delicious differences I'm sure!<br /><br />Oh man I just got an awesome idea. Mini matcha shortbreads for summer, using the different flavours of matcha! Ah! I can't wait to see how the flavour translates into a simple flour, butter, sugar cookie. Paired with an iced matcha. On the front porch. Okay I don't have a front porch : ( But I have the makings of the rest of it :D<br /><br />I don't know if I mentioned this in my other reviews - but this matcha (and the others) has an amazing echo of taste. The aftertaste of the natural flavours lingers long after I'm finished the cup. To be honest, it kind of makes me crave more. If I wasn't already bouncing off the walls with matcha energy, I might make more! No joke. This stuff packs a serious energy punch. I've been having it every morning! I feel lucky :)"

If you look at the ingredients on all of this series of Larabars, then you'll see that it has only 3-4 ingredients like the fruit itself, dates and some form of nuts. It doesn't have sugar, salt or other preservatives. Because of the dates, it has natural sweetness and because of the nuts, it has natural saltiness. The nuts also give this bar it's calories (an average bar is about 200 calories).  The taste is well ... not like eating a Nature Valley snack bar. The taste is more like eating mashed fruit and nuts mixed together with dates. If you don't like dates or have a thing against dates, I wouldn't buy any of this series of Larabars because 90% of them have dates as a main ingredients. I think they use it as a natural binder. Because of this, I find that a majority of their bars taste kind of the same ... heavily flavored with dates.<br /><br />But, if you're trying to snack healthily and want to avoid processed foods and those sugary / salty snacks in the ""snack bar"" aisle at the supermarket, this is the bar to go with. Plus, if you buy it in bulk from Amazon, it comes out to be less than $1.25 / bar whereas at the markets it can go as high as $2.00+ / bar.  You just need to go the market and try all the flavors first before you commit to 16 bars of the same flavor at Amazon. It would suck to order 16 bars of a flavor and find out that you can stand the taste of it after the fact."

Only drawback here is that these are not available with the  super saver program with 15% off and free shipping. I don't want to pay $11 to have it shipped to me.  Sorry!"
