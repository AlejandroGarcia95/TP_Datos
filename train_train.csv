Unlike some breakfast bars, these protein bars are regular granola-bar sized, and are also fairly filling; they work great as a morning snack to keep you full for several hours.<br /><br />The bar doesn't have cereal, and is a bit gritty when chewing, but the bar in total makes up for it. I have already gone through several boxes of these and have enjoyed eating them."

I was drinking the Starbucks Africa and Verona before ""the breakup.""  I tried the Dark Breakfast from Gevalia, but it's horrible.  I can only drink it after adding the Maestro Lorenzo Espresso Intensivo.  That makes quite a nice cup with a good kick to it.  I even need a little cream in it to smooth it out a bit.<br /><br />But this one is just right.  It's a nice strong cup that doesn't need cream, but can take cream without losing flavor.  This is the first hope I have had for saving my Tassimo machine.  I don't want to go back to the Keurig.<br /><br />p.s.  I would still like a good decaf option.  Right now I use the Gevalia Signature decaf and add a shot of Gevalia decaf espresso to jazz it up."

I do not dislike them, though I love the store ones, and have decided to keep them. Salsa can fix anything. However, I will not purchase them again in bulk from Amazon. My biggest disappointment has been that the company never responded to my email."

It is fortified with various vitamins such as C and the B series, and electrolytes, with zero calories, sugar and carbohydrates.  I found its taste to be too sweet that I opted to dilute it in half with freshly squeezed orange juice; the punch's taste was still quite sweet even after I had diluted it. Others, however, may feel differently about the drink's taste. Without a doubt, it is a worthy addition to energy boosting drinks of which Gatorade may be the best known - and best loved - example.  For the active sports enthusiast, this is a drink that should be considered as a potential substitute for Gatorade."

When you go into the pet store, looking for toys, what do you find? There are things that roll, things to hunt, feathers and fur to tantalize and tickle.  Only PetStages has recognized that, yes, sometimes cats do enjoy the feeling of chomping down on something and giving it a hard shake for good measure.  That's why I love this company so much.  Their toys are not only unique, they are also intuitive to what cats both enjoy and need.  As for this particular item, my Timmy has never outgrown it.  From kittenhood to almost 4 years old, he's gone through a long string of Catnip Chew Toys.  In fact, many's the morning when he's hopped out of bed, groomed himself momentarily, and started chewing and tossing his catnip ring.  I think he likes this one better than the other chewing rings by Petstages because the cloth is smooth and has a firm filling of fibers.  He will literally drive his teeth through the cloth as hard as he can.  Personally, I'm happy because:  A# He's happy.  B) He's cleaning his own teeth.  C)I'd much rather he be chewing on a ring then on my fingers or somewhere inappropriate!  #Which has never been a problem, btw.  Then again, he's always had one of these toys!)  Anyway, when my local pet store stopped carrying them, I panicked.  Thank goodness Amazon and KV sells them online.  And for a far cheaper price, I might add!!!"

I ordered this 2-pack and I love it so much that I've already ordered a pound of the traditional variety! Even my husband (who barely tolerates peanut butter) likes PB2. He says it tastes more like peanuts than traditional peanut butter (and I think he's right).<br /><br />The chocolate variety was originally described to me as ""similar to nutella"" and unfortunately, I don't think it is. It's just a slightly sweeter, vaguely chocolatey version of the original PB2. It's good, but it will never be as satisfying as nutella.<br /><br />Overall, I love both varieties of PB2. They're best mixed in with other ingredients, like in a PBJ sandwich or in baked goods. My favorite use is to put 2 tablespoons in a berry smoothie, which adds protein and makes it taste like a PBJ. If you try to eat PB2 solo, by the spoonful, you might be disappointed. They are lacking a bit of the richness that makes peanut butter so addictive.<br /><br />Lastly, this stuff is pricier than regular peanut butter (especially when you consider that the powder is fluffy and it loses volume when you mix it with water), but I think it's well worth the cost."

I brewed 1.5 tsp in a little over a cup of not-quite boiling water, and the flavor is beautifully subtle, not overpowering. This tea is surprisingly sweet, perfect by itself. I'm used to buying tea of this quality for about $12 for 2 oz, not 1lb. The double-layer bag was bigger than I expected, with a ziplock like closure at the top to keep the tea fresh.

I even used to make my own when I was younger. I've tried a variety of brands before but this is the first time trying out Wild Ride. It claims to be Hormone and Nitrate free with no added MSG, and while the ingredients listed do confirm their claims this beef jerky has got to be some of the driest, tasteless I have ever eaten.<br /><br />Kickin' Teriyaki is the flavor I got. To be sure I didn't just get a bad package I opened two bags and both sets of jerky was dry and tasteless. I do not taste anything ""kickin"" about this jerky and there is virtually no Teriyaki flavor either. To make things worse the dry jerky tends to have a powdery taste to it because it is made with Soy Sauce POWDER instead of Soy Sauce (this is to get around saying it has no added MSG). Instead of imparting a nice Teriyaki flavor you get this powedery taste to the jerky and mixed with the bit of onion and corn starch in the jerky, it almost is like they coated it with onion powder instead of Teriyaki.<br /><br />On the plus side however, this is a nitrate free product which is a good thing as many other jerkies tend to have Sodium Nitrate in them. Also with both packages I have opened currently, the jerky breaks down easily and isn't tough as leather nor does it contain any sinew it seems.<br /><br />OVERALL this jerky just seems extremely tasteless and powdery. While it doesn't contain ""added"" MSG, Nitrates or hormones, they got around this by using powdered versions of ingredients (powdered vinegar and soy sauce) plus it contains Dextrose and Fructose , modified food starch and corn starch and SUGAR is your second ingredient. I've never seen so much sugar and starch added to jerky in my life. So despite being hormone and nitrate free, this jerky (in my opinion) is barely palatable and should be avoided"
525158,B000WLXMVQ,AJ742QZZQ1WLI,Chick RIchie,2,2,5,1325462400,Diabetic's Dream,"For type 2 diabetics trying to control blood sugar by diet alone or with minimal medication the Walden Farms brand is heaven sent.  I have been using their dressings for several years.  Not all of their dressings are as good, in my opinion, as the Thousand Island but all will help control blood sugars.  What I like about the Thousand Island particularly is the creamy texture of the dressing and the taste.  You can use it on salads, burger melts or in a low carb rueben wrap. (I use the Santa Fe Tortilla 6 carb wrap)<br /><br />People who complain that Walden Farms products don't taste the same as 'normal' dressings have a valid point and it shows how much we have come to equate 'good taste' with sugar.  One way to check out your favorite dressing or catsup is to look at the ingredients and see how high sugar, corn syrup, and high fructose corn sugar, is on the list. It is no surprise that sugar is often up there near the top and often listed multiple times. Some dressings produced by major brands, however, have only two carbs per serving.  For many people, myself included, this is a tossup.  In some cases taste and cost may swing toward buying the major brand.  For more selections check at the Walden Farms website and don't forget to check at your local grocery or health food store to compare prices on this brand.<br /><br />Clearly, if you are looking to control your families intake of carbs, the Walden Farms brand is a good choice.  If you know of other brands with zero carbs that taste as good or better please add your comments to this review.  There is nothing I like better than hearing about something that tastes great with zero or low carbs.  Your comments may assist myself and others who are living with diabetes and want to live a better and longer life."

We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit ""add to cart"" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought ""oh, boy"" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The ""burnt"" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . ."

I couldn't have been happier!  I knew his history and that he's had skin problems since he was a baby.  Different vets have been unable to determine the cause of his itchy scratchy scaliness, and different medicines and types of food were tried.  This food hasn't been the cure, but he's doing much better since starting this last year.  His coat was always a bit thin and I never wanted to brush him for fear of irritating already irritated skin, but I actually had to buy him a brush this year.  His coat's filled out and he doesn't have as much skin problems as he used to have.  Thankfully he's just a little guy, otherwise this stuff would break the bank!

I can't really think of any ""American"" counterpart that most people would be familiar with. I was introduced to it by a nephew of mine who loves snacks from Asian markets. This is a Korean chocolate type of snack.<br /><br />It's a sponge sandwich with a cream filling all covered in a layer of chocolate. When you bite into it, it's the texture that you enjoy first, your teeth break into the thin chocolate skin then sinks into the sponge and cream. Then you masticate and mix it all up in your mouth. The taste is great too, it's a creamy, chocolately, sponge cakey taste. Most important, it's not too sweet, like many creamy chocolately snacks.<br /><br />It's hard to review tastes to people because it's so subjective. All I can say is that it manages to mix up those 3 ingredients (cream, chocolate, sponge) up very well and you should give it a try if you like these kind of things.

I decided to give this a try in my coffee, instead.  It's hard to imagine something being sweet and bitter, but that about sums up Purevia.  Not the best.  You can soften the bitter with a little honey, but I'm moving on.<br /><br />Stevia is probably behind Purevia's bitter taste, as it is a well-known complaint of that sweetener.  I'm going to try the main sweetener in Purevia, which is Erythrinol, a naturally occuring fruit sugar. The famous natural foods Dr., Dr. Weil, highly recommends it, not only for taste, but he believes it's one of the safer sugar substitutes.  Not much in the way of calories, doesn't cause tooth-decay, gastric disturbances are rare from it etc.  Sounds good.  You can buy it on Amazon in pure form, although one company got some bad reviews because they were selling Erythrinol that had a musty taste (the company was something forest).  I ordered mine from Now Foods.  Still waiting.  Good luck.<br /><br />Update:  I got my Erythrinol, and added about 4 spoonfuls to a cup of coffee, since it's only supposed to be 60-70% as sweet as sugar.  Very quickly, my stomach became upset, and it only took like 20 minutes for this sugar to liquify my entire intestinal track.  Not good.  Also, there is a decidely unpleasant effect in the throat that is hard to describe.  If you've ever had hard candy sweetened with xylitol, you may know what I mean...the feeling that you want to cough because of something chemical, or perhaps your eyes water a little etc.  The sweetness was fine, just didn't care for all of the effects.  It probably needs to be mixed with another sweetener, as it is in Purevia.<br /><br />Right now, I'm trying Splenda, and it's not too bad.  See how it sits."

It would be great to do that with it because of the way the roots are growing but even if not, its still a great tree. I give it a 5 because of the great quality the plant came in. The only problem to me was that it dont have the netting over the drainage holes and the packageing wasnt like my other. My other was packaged nice and sturdy so it wouldnt topple over or anything and this one was just put in the box and filled with enough foam peanuts to keep it from moving. Which suprisingly didnt mess up any of the leaves or branches. The box was handed to me laying on its side and didnt even say which side was up. I was kinda disappointed with the packaging from how great my P. afra was packaged just 2 days b4 I recieved this one. But this is a product review and not a packageing review.

But as an asthmatic, I find litter box cleaning with clay litter to be unbearable. I end up coughing and wheezing from the dust and chemical perfumes. Luckily, this has never been an issue with this product. I started using Swheat Scoop in 2007, maybe before that, and I have never had any issues with dust or bugs.<br /><br />Frankly, the bug issue is not as big of a deal as I have been reading in other reviews. This is exactly what can happen with all-purpose flour too. These bugs are notorious for finding their way into pantries, and I am sure they can get into this litter if improperly stored in a warehouse. Just treat this litter like you already should be handling flour, wheat bread and similar food in your pantry, which is a place that is much more likely to have meal worm issues.<br /><br />The clumping is not the same as with clay litter. That is, the clumps don't form into one neat ball. But I don't find it hard to clean the box with this litter. It does actually clump and only forms a bunch of little balls as someone mentioned if you break it apart with the scooper. I use a very large scoop to prevent that. As for the smell, there is barely any scent to the litter itself and it only stinks if you are cleaning your box any less than once a day, which is not enough for any type of litter. The website actually had a couple of tips for clumping: adding cooking spray or a sheet of wax paper to the bottom of the box and sprinkling a bit of baking soda to help with clumping and odor.<br /><br />Since there are pros and cons to everything, you really have to weigh what you would rather deal with. In my experience, I would much rather deal with litter that does not clump neatly into one ball than with dusty, perfume-y litter that makes it hard to breath."

My husband and I couldn't get enough of the chicken she made.  When I asked her what amazing marinade was on it, she said it was olive oil and this seasoning- that was it!. Her brother, who's a chef, recommended it.  I went to 4 different stores looking for it. It never dissapoints. If I need a quick dinner, I take an 8 piece cut-up chicken, pour a little olive oil over it, rub it in, then sprinkle the rotisserie seasoning over it (maybe 1-3 tbsp), rub that in, too, and that's it. No salt and pepper is needed.  Sometimes I cut up onions and put them in the bottom of the pan. I bake everything at 375, covered, for an hour, or until I see it's done, then uncover it to let it brown...best chicken, ever! And the seasoning is kosher, so it's perfect for Shabbos chicken.  This week I put fingerling potatoes and sliced onions in the bottom of the pan, tossed them with a little garlic powder, olive oil, salt and pepper, then put chicken on top and seasoned like I mentioned above, letting some of the rotisserie seasoning fall on the potatoes....it was wonderful!"

For whatever reason, I missed the pod image in the picture, so when I received this I ended up using several pods to create a full pot of coffee. This did impact anyone who is wondering what it might be like to brew one individual pod, which I will try to brew with my father's french press. Anywho, on with the review. I just wanted to be up front when I say that my experience might not be like that of someone who owns a Senseo.<br /><br />Smell-wise, this stuff is awesome. It smelled great when I was brewing it, which is honestly about 30-40% of what I (and many others) enjoy most about coffee. Taste-wise, this was pretty good. It's definitely a dark roast, so if you prefer a more mild flavor then you'll probably want to look elsewhere. (Not sure if Marley coffee has a lighter roast, but they probably should.) It's not Charbucks, so no worries about it being too roasted.<br /><br />I brewed this at work and after the pre-requisite jokes about a ""pot"" of coffee and such, we all set about to consuming it. Now while we do have to put up with some of the worst free coffee possible, it only serves to help us appreciate the good stuff when it comes along, and this is some good stuff and was pretty well received. I had a lot of people that came back and told me that they really enjoyed the brew. (For food items, if I can get a wider opinion, I try to do so because hey- not all opinions are the same when it comes to any product.) So if you have a Senseo that multiple people use or if you're considering buying a regular bag for multiple people to use, this is something you can get for a wide audience of drinkers.<br /><br />I have to say, this is something that I'd actually purchase with my own money later on down the line. It's a good coffee and while I don't base my purchases on the whole ""organic, fair trade"" stuff, I know that others do and I have to admit that it is nice to think that the coffee purchase potentially helped someone other than myself. (The whole organic, fair trade thing didn't really factor into my opinion, but I know that this is important to some consumers so I wanted to make sure to make a note of this since the product description for this didn't have any of this in it.)"

Now, the best thing here is that cotton isn't even a food crop, so when you consume cottonseed oil you fill up on who knows what kind of fertiliser and what not. This great Christian businessman sure knew how to get rich selling poisonous crap to the masses.<br /><br />PS. Even when it's not cottonseed oil, ""vegetable oil"" is something to avoid, as it's something cheap, chemically processed. How chemically?

He isn't motivated by food at all, and it's always a trial and error when it comes to trying out a new treat.  His treats of choice are freeze-dried tripe, freeze-dried liver, freeze-dried chicken - you get the idea.  The boy has expensive taste - lol.<br /><br />That said, since he's now nearing the 9 year old mark, I wanted to begin giving him Glucosamine and Chondroitin for his hips and joints.  I started to notice that he has become a little reluctant to jump up on the bed, preferring to be helped up.  I think this is happening due to getting older. My usage of these treats is to help with prevention - better to start early before it's too late, you know?<br /><br />Feeding him pills is a hassle, and I'm already giving him globs of peanut butter a day to hide his <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015GS0BY"">Nutri-Vet Healthy Vision Canine Chewables</a> (I highly recommend these pills if you have a dog with vision issues).  Anyway, my quest for a non-pill form of Glucosamine and Chondroitin led me to Zuke's Hip Action.<br /><br />I love that it's wheat, corn and soy free.  My boy has skin allergies and I've been doing my best to keep his diet as clean as possible.  Each treat has 300 mg of Glucosamine and 50 mg of Chondroitin.  The treats also have antioxidants thanks to cherry, blueberry, rosemary, turmeric and seasame seed.  BTW - turmeric is a great Indian spice that also helps humans because of its anti-inflammatory benefits.  It also has egg shell membrane meal, which according to the package helps support joint health.  So, it has good stuff in it.  It's also made in the USA.  After all the issues with Chinese-made dog treats, avoiding treats from China is important to me and the health of my dog.<br /><br />For a small 46 lbs and under dog (like my Ozzy), only one treat is necessary per day.  For a medium dog of 98 lbs and under, 2 treats a day is necessary.  For a giant dog of 138 lbs and under, 3 treats are needed per day.  Each package has about 23 treats in it.  If you have a larger size dog, it definitely can get pricey.<br /><br />I feed Ozzy the peanut butter flavor, because, well, peanut butter is one of his favorite things in the world.  Each treat is square and has a moist look to it.  It has an interesting smell - not one of my favorites, but not completely a turn-off either.  Just...interesting.  But the best part is he LOVES them.  His eyes actually bug out more than the usual chihuahua buggy-eyed look, and he happily grabs it and runs off to enjoy it.  He looks forward to it every day.<br /><br />Ozzy recently had surgery on his ear, and during the time after his surgery, he was pickier than ever with food.  He refused to eat even the raw beef patties that he usually loves.  He barely even took the peanut butter hiding his eye vitamins, probiotics and antibiotics (and this is a dog that loves peanut butter)  But these Zuke treats?  Heck yeah! Never a problem.  Just goes to show how much he loves these treats."

I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  The fig wasn't overpowering and it tasted a lot like a graham cracker.  I could easily have one or two of these as a snack.  However, I doubt I could eat more than that in one sitting.  While they were good, they were a bit on the dry side and even the dried fruit didn't help with that.  So I would have to say, if you're trying to diet and looking for a quick snack, the Newton Fruit Thins are a good choice.  For a larger snack, not so much.<br /><br />I did have my husband and son try them, with mixed results.  While my four year old loved them and wanted to have more, the hubby wasn't sold.  He thought that the dried fruit was barely noticeable and they could've definitely use more.  Also, the crunchy factor took away from the whole experience.<br /><br />Edited on 5/3/11: One thing I have noticed, if you leave the crackers/cookies out, unsealed, a lot of the crunchiness disappears; they are a little softer without taking any of the flavor away.  I'm actually liking them a lot more this way too."

I know that they can't say specifically, because it would probably depend on the issue you are trying to treat, but if they could at least say give anywhere from 10-100000 a day in general that would help out a LOT. The vet I most recently went to was the typical all about the money man who milks every person for every dime he can & quite frankly shouldn't have been working with cats in the first place (he was obviously uncomfortable handling them). When I asked him about fiber options the ONLY thing he recommended was a Science Diet food that he was getting high dollar paid for selling (they are known for pushing that brand at their office) I had to research on my own to find these treats & when I called them about possibly getting an idea of how many to feed daily of course they had no idea. All I can say about most vets these days is one word- GREED!<br /><br />My cat likes the treats- she will eat pretty much any treat though so this was no surprise.

I like the pouch in that it is easy to squeeze out in to a bowl and then store away, and I think its more travel friendly then say, carrying a glass jar, but in terms of the taste, it taste just about the same, to me, as any other baby food, it still taste like stale cook fruits and vegetables, but that's not a bad thing, since pretty much all pre-made baby food is that way.

The hottest tastes stronger than either of these bottled sauces and their liquid texture coats the taco layers better.

I'm a hot sauce fanatic and I love habenero hot sauces, but habenero hot sauce just doesn't work on a taco like this stuff does.

I buy this stuff on the west coast for $1.29 a bottle at the grocery store, bubble wrap it and bring it home in my luggage. I think about this hot sauce some times. It's amazing. To put it in perspective for you west coasters, I hate Tapatio. It's got too much vinegar. This stuff does not. I would like to thank the creator of this hot suace, because it's that good.

(they also included one flavor that had menadione sodium bisulfate - a known carcinigen - listed on the can, but when I called I was assured they eliminated that from all flavors last year, and that they just haven't ""caught up"" with new labels yet.  hmmmmm.<br /><br />If you are feeding this food, do YOU feed according to the label instructions?<br /><br />I've been feeding/offering 1-2 cans of Fancy Feast Classic/day to my 2 cats, but they never finish it.<br /><br />Why do I need to almost triple that amount of Tiki Cat?  (I do put out high quality (40% protein) kibble 24/7.  A good quality, high protein kibble fills up cats in all the right ways, so one expects them to eat less. My cats only eat 1/2 cup of kibble/day (that's total for both, not each cat!)  Seems way too little, but they maintain their weight just fine on it and the FF. So, I have to wonder about how TikiCat came up with the huge amount needed to feed?<br /><br />I'd love to hear what others do. If cats ""need"" that many cans of TIKI CAT, then each can must be very low on nutrients, as I assume to get the proper nutrients, they need all those cans as per the label?  I hope someone can make sense out of this.  I emailed the company just now as I totally missed that last line until placing an order for Hookena Luau, Hana Luau & Napili Luau.

Then when you add your milk, it doesn't leave little lumps of Stevita floating on the top of your chocolate milk ( kind of like what happens with Ovaltine, which I also used to love ) I found that if I over do adding it to the milk it is too sweet, and doesn't taste as good as when you use just a little.

They only said, ""don't worry, he will ear eventually.""  We tried everything from Eukanuba, to Science diet, you name it we probably tried it.  We ended up with a cupboard full of bags that had less than a cup of food taken out of each.  He eventually started eating a little, I guess just enough to have something in his stomach, but not nearly the amount he should be eating.  It was pretty stressfull, as this was our first time actually owning a dog.  It got to the point where we'd walk him, and people would comment about how skinny he was.  Sad, I know.<br /><br />Finally someone recommended we try Wellness.  Now, I will say that we were a little hesitant at first, because it was a bit on the pricey side.  And we really didn't know that much about pet food.  We figured, you know, he's a dog, so long as he's not eating table scraps, it shouldn't matter that much (read: we were very ignorant).  Boy were we wrong, and since then, we've come a long way.  After checking out the Wellness site and really doing some research, we decided that it was worth it.  So we bought a little bag to, you know, try it out.  Just in case Nero didn't like it.  To our surprise, he loved the stuff!  Scarfed it down like I've never seen him do before.  My boyfriend and I both stood there silently while we watched him eat a whole bowl of food for the first time.<br /><br />Needless to say, after that we went online and bought a whole 30-pound bag.  I love that my dog loves this stuff, and I love that it's also good for him.  I mean, this stuff is human-grade.  HUMAN GRADE!<br /><br />People are also always commenting on how good our dog looks, how shiny his coat is.  It's definitely noticeable that he's eating well.

Slightly milky flavor, and a touch of blue cheese give these an edge (literally and figuratively) over the competition. It's great that part of the ingredients are organic (I wish of course that they were all organic at this price). Don't be surprised when you open the bag, they fill just under a third of it. I guess the empty space keeps them in shape! Now the bad part, when you buy 12 at once you expect a discount. The Amazon price of $2.58 each is the same as at my local high priced natural food store. Still, nobody comes close flavor wise, although flavor is, of course, subjective.<br /><br />UPDATE December 11, 2009<br />Could I have been more disappointed with the makers of Cheese Curls? I stopped buying the baked cheese puffs from the same brand because the quality varies from one batch (by the expiration date) to another, and the last batch had too many puffs without cheese. Back to the curls, the previous batch (November) was just excellent (good flavor and crispiness as reported by my wife), but then came the one I bought just a week ago...there is not a single curl with proper cheese flavor in the bags. So why not complain? I am complaining, but the company doesn't care. I told them last year that the quality of the puffs varied from one batch to another, and it only got worse. The retail price has increased to $2.95 since then. At that price I expect a very good product, especially when I buy 12 at a time. Notice that it says on the back of the bag ""freshness guaranteed."" That's right, they don't care whether we're happy with the product, just that it's fresh. Thanks Michael Seasons, I guess I'll have to start making my own cheese curls (there is no other product on the market that uses (partially) organic ingredients).

It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.

Alas, with this container, you need to pour all of the contents and put what you don't need into a tupperware dish -- thus creating more dirtied dishes in your life.<br /><br />The second disappointment was the appearance upon pouring.  I definitely eat food first with my eyes.  When I poured the soup into a bowl, there were giant curds intermingled with oily broth, carrots and celery.  This soup is made with milk so I am guessing that was what caused the curds.  I had to use a whisk to break them up.  After heating the soup, the base was still very oily.  See a photo of the soup in the product image gallery.<br /><br />The third disappointment was the taste and texture of the soup.  The soup is oily, filmy and I don't think it is thick enough to be called a chowder.  The manufacturer was very light on the use of rosemary.  I wouldn't call this a rosemary potato chowder.  I would call this flavored liquid with some finely diced potatoes and a dash of rosemary.<br /><br />The fourth disappointment was the nutritional profile.  This container has 2 one cup servings.  Each one cup serving has 230 calories, 8 grams of fat, 25% of your daily saturated fat (5 grams) and 30% of your daily sodium.  See a shot of the nutritional profile in the product image gallery.<br /><br />If you have the time, I would make your own potato soup.  Imagine Soup carries a large line of soup bases, including a potato flavor.  If you add potatoes, onion, carrots and some spices, you will have a soup that is much more texturally appealing, flavorful and nutritional (that soup base has 110 calories per cup).<br /><br />This product is vegetarian.<br /><br />This product is made in the United States."

I filled my salt dish with it and use it for cooking and all salt uses.<br /><br />I discovered Cardia Salt in a New York Times article that stated that it's not the sodium that's bad for you, it's when the sodium/potassium ratio gets out of whack, and that in the US we use way too much salt and get far too little potassium, which is in all whole foods, but not in processed foods we eat too much of. In Finland they call it Pan Salt, and I read in the Times article that they put the whole country of Finland on Pan Salt and reduced their cardiac disease by 60%!!!<br /><br />Try Cardia Salt, you will love it. Be sure to take a kelp pill to get your iodine.<br /><br />A note to the manufacturers - please package it in bulk like sugar or salt instead of the individual little shakers that are hard to break into.

308763,B0002MS8GY,A2724DVAK5O38V,L. Sudduth,6,9,1,1260230400,Avoid the Granny Smitth Apple Coffee Cake ... Unless you Like to eat Mold,"Do not waste your money on the Granny Smith Apple Coffee-Cake version, unless you like to eat mold! Just so you know, you won't easily be able to detect the mold except by taste. It shows up adjacent to the apples, and in the cinnamon strip in the center of the cake.<br /><br />The one star that I had to give Granny Smith Apple Coffee-Cake in my review was merited, however. I did not get sick from eating some of a piece of the coffee cake ... the phenolic flavor of which caused me to pull apart the cake, and identify that gray fuzziness which hallmarks mold. No diarrhea. No puking. Well worth one star.<br /><br />My story. The week after Thanksgiving (2009), I received one of the Granny Smith Apple Coffee-Cakes as a gift from my aunt. According to the label, she had purchased it the first week of November 2009 at Walter Reed Hospital (military) commissary. After detecting the mold, I resealed it in its packaging material, what the company describes as a reusable freezer bag. I placed it in my freezer, including the outer box, anticipating sending it back to the company for examination.<br /><br />A note about the packaging. When I first opened the coffee cake's box, the inner (reusable freezer) bag conformed tightly with the cake, and the tape sealing the bag was undisturbed. While the flyer included with the coffee cake advises that the product is stable for up to a year, I believe this could be overly optimistic if the mold eats cake quickly. On the bright side, as the mold progresses, it's likely to become more visible during the course of a year.<br /><br />Know that if you don't heed my warning you're on your own. The company will not stand by their product. When I called their 'customer service' number, the woman advised me to return it to the military commissary where my aunt purchased it. Not being in the military, I can not get on the facility within which the commissary is located. Further, I'm not the boorish type, so the idea of returning the gift to my aunt as inedible was not an option.<br /><br />As we spoke, the customer service woman asked me 'if I had a problem with Campbell's soup would I call Campbell's soup, or take the soup back to the grocery store?' I'd get in touch with Campbell's about defective soup ... if for no other reason than to allow them to recall the product. Bottom line, she could no nothing for me as I had not bought the coffee cake directly from My Grandma's.<br /><br />When I related to the customer service woman that I would endeavor to communicate my dissatisfaction with the Granny Smith Apple Coffee-Cake, and their customer service, to the extent that I was able, she put me on hold. Twice she came back on the line, asking me to continue to hold ... advising that held calls could only stay on hold for a short while. The call disconnected after this.  There was no discussion on either of our parts with respect to the desired resolution. My only option for the moldy Granny Smith Apple Coffee-Cake was to return it.<br /><br />With natural foodstuffs, especially those not chock-full of preservatives, it seems likely that problems might crop up every now and again. I would've been content to ship the coffee-cake back to them (at their cost) to let their experts determine what was wrong, how it likely happened, and whether or not a recall was indicated ... after which I would've hoped for a replacement coffee cake.<br /><br />The crappy customer service ensured this didn't transpire."

This is one of the few health bar that doesn't give you that sugar high and then nap time afterward.<br /><br />As a working individual that logs a lot of hours behind a monitor, sometime it is difficult to grab a meal when you are in the middle of something. So for the past few years, I've been stashing a collection of nutritional bar at my desk. Usually, that stash consist of items on sale from either Amazon or Vons. I've many different bars, from Clif Bar, Nature Valley's Granola Bar, to Balance Bar. None of them can compare to KIND bar. I've actually never heard about this company until a sale on Amazon, but due to great reviews. Which is why I want to put in my 2 cents as well."

I was at an impasse for a long time until I saw this product on Blue's website.  I already had a $400 condenser mic in the closet I had never gotten to use and didn't want to spend more money on a quality USB mic.  I couldn't be happy that this product exists - in it's quality or price!  I noticed no noise or coloration of the signal and it worked without a problem.  It does exactly what it's suppose to do -- act like it doesn't exist.  It just serves it purpose to convert the signal well, and stays out of the way on everything else.  It does feel light weight and the signal was a little lower than i thought (as many reviews said) and that is the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars.  But I don't think that should keep anyone from getting this product."

More importantly, my dog adores them. I use them as an extra special treat, usually just for when he goes into his crate. As soon as he notices that I have one in my hand, he runs to his crate and waits, tail wagging. The only downside is that the liver cubes smell horrible (to humans, anyway) and leave a powdery residue behind. But as some other reviews have noted, the powder is great for sprinkling on dry food for a finicky dog."

Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks.

I love the fact you get all the different flavors and as of yet I have not found a flavor I did not like. Being from England I am very picky about my flavors of chips or crisps as I would call them as there seems to be such limited flavors but this box gives me flavors I can't complain. I also love the fact that 5% fat is the fat content which just makes them an even better snack. My only issue now is that I have to fight my husband and son over them because they love them just as much as I do. I have now had to go to a box a month but even then I am not sure I can have enough for the month with the three of us eating them every chance we can.

I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around."

I'm a sucker for nuts and peanut butter anyhow so I gave one of the bars to a friend of mine.  All I told him was that it was a new granola bar I was trying and what did he think.  He loved them also--but almost didn't believe it was intended as anything other than candy.  Will I buy any at the store?  The only reason I wouldn't is because they're addictive.  Yummy!"
